# ETL Pipeline Monitoring using Luigi

## What is ETL?
ETL is a process that extracts the data from different source systems, then 
transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) 
and finally loads the data into the Data Warehouse system. ETL is a
fundamental process in Data Analytics since messy, noisy data would not
lead you anywhere even with the best data analytics method. In ETL process
we make sure that the data is ready to use to support business decision making

## Luigi
Luigi is a Python package that helps you build complex pipelines of 
batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, 
visualization, handling failures, command line integration, and much more.
It was first written by Spotify and became open source in 2012. The interesting
part of Luigi is it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) showing status
of the tasks and graphical representation of your pipeline.
